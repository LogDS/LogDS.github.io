            "summary": "Although current efforts are all aimed at re-defining new ways to harness old data representations, possibly with new schema features, the challenges still open provide evidence of the need for a \"diametrically opposite\" approach: in fact, all information generated in real contexts is to be understood lacking of any form of schema, where the schema associated with such data is only determined a posteriori based on either a specific application context, or from some data's facets of interest. This solution should still enable recommendation systems to manipulate the aforementioned data semantically. After providing evidence of these limitations from current literature, we propose a new Generalized Semistructured data Model that makes possible queries expressible in any data representation through a Generalised Semistructured Query Language, both relying upon script v2.0 as a MetaModel language manipulating types as terms as well as allowing structural aggregation functions.",

            "summary": "This paper considers a specification rewriting meachanism for a specific fragment of Linear Temporal Logic for Finite traces, DECLAREd, working through an equational logic and rewriting mechanism under customary practitioner assumptions from the Business Process Management literature. By rewriting the specification into an equivalent formula which might be easier to compute, we aim to streamline current state-of-the-art temporal artificial intelligence algorithms working on temporal logic. As this specification rewriting mechanism is ultimately also able to determine with the provided specification is a tautology (always true formula) or a formula containing a temporal contradiction, by detecting the necessity of a specific activity label to be both present and absent within a log, this implies that the proved mechanism is ultimately a SAT-solver for DECLAREd. We prove for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that this fragment is a polytime fragment of LTLf, while all the previously-investigated fragments or extensions of such a language were in polyspace. We test these considerations over formal synthesis (Lydia), SAT-Solvers (AALTAF) and formal verification (KnoBAB) algorithms, where formal verification can be also run on top of a relational database and can be therefore expressed in terms of relational query answering. We show that all these benefit from the aforementioned assumptions, as running their tasks over a rewritten equivalent specification will improve their running times, thus motivating the pressing need of this approach for practical temporal artificial intelligence scenarios. We validate such claims by testing such algorithms over a Cybersecurity dataset.",

            "summary": "Despite the growing popularity of techniques related to graph summarization, a general operator for joining graphs on both the vertices and the edges is still missing. Current languages such as Cypher and SPARQL express binary joins through the non-scalable and inefficient composition of multiple traversal and graph creation operations. In this paper, we propose an efficient equi-join algorithm that is able to perform vertex and path joins over a secondary memory indexed graph, also the resulting graph is serialised in secondary memory. The results show that the implementation of the proposed model outperforms solutions based on graphs, such as Neo4J and Virtuoso, and the relational model, such as PostgreSQL. Moreover, we propose two ways how edges can be combined, namely the conjunctive and disjunctive semantics, Preliminary experiments on the graph conjunctive join are also carried out with incremental updates, thus suggesting that our solution outperforms materialized views over PostgreSQL.",
