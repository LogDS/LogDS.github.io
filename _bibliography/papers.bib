ABSTRACT = {Marine mammal monitoring, a growing field of research, is critical to cetacean conservation. Traditional `tagging’ attaches sensors such as GPS to such animals, though these are intrusive and susceptible to infection and, ultimately, death. A less intrusive approach exploits UUV commanded by a human operator above ground. The development of AI for autonomous underwater vehicle navigation models training environments in simulation, providing visual and physical fidelity suitable for sim-to-real transfer. Previous solutions, including UVMS and L2D, provide only satisfactory results, due to poor environment generalisation while sensors including sonar create environmental disturbances. Though rich in features, image data suffer from high dimensionality, providing a state space too great for many machine learning tasks. Underwater environments, susceptible to image noise, further complicate this issue. We propose SWIM v2.0,type=symbolslist,unit=},

ABSTRACT = {To the best of our knowledge, we offer the first IoT-Osmotic simulator supporting 6G and Cloud infrastructures, leveraging the similarities in Software-Defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN) architectures when used in Osmotic architectures and User-Centric Cell-Free mMIMO (massive multiple-input multiple-output) architectures. Our simulator acts as a simulator orchestrator, supporting the interaction with a patient digital twin generating patient healthcare data (vital signs and emergency alerts) and a VANET simulator (SUMO), both leading to IoT data streams towards the cloud through pre-initiated MQTT protocols. This contextualises our approach within the healthcare domain while showcasing the possibility of orchestrating different simulators at the same time. The combined provision of these two aspects, joined with the addition of a ring network connecting all the first-mile edge nodes (i.e., access points), enables the definition of new packet routing algorithms, streamlining previous solutions from SD-WAN architectures, thus showing the benefit of 6G architectures in achieving better network load balancing, as well as showcasing the limitations of previous approaches. The simulated 6G architecture, combined with the optimal routing algorithm and MEL (Microelements software components) allocation policy, was able to reduce the time required to route all communications from IoT devices to the cloud by up to 50.4% compared to analogous routing algorithms used within 5G architectures.},

	abstract = {This paper considers a specification rewriting meachanism for a specific fragment of Linear Temporal Logic for Finite traces, DECLAREd, working through an equational logic and rewriting mechanism under customary practitioner assumptions from the Business Process Management literature. By rewriting the specification into an equivalent formula which might be easier to compute, we aim to streamline current state-of-the-art temporal artificial intelligence algorithms working on temporal logic. As this specification rewriting mechanism is ultimately also able to determine with the provided specification is a tautology (always true formula) or a formula containing a temporal contradiction, by detecting the necessity of a specific activity label to be both present and absent within a log, this implies that the proved mechanism is ultimately a SAT-solver for DECLAREd. We prove for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that this fragment is a polytime fragment of LTLf, while all the previously-investigated fragments or extensions of such a language were in polyspace. We test these considerations over formal synthesis (Lydia), SAT-Solvers (AALTAF) and formal verification (KnoBAB) algorithms, where formal verification can be also run on top of a relational database and can be therefore expressed in terms of relational query answering. We show that all these benefit from the aforementioned assumptions, as running their tasks over a rewritten equivalent specification will improve their running times, thus motivating the pressing need of this approach for practical temporal artificial intelligence scenarios. We validate such claims by testing such algorithms over a Cybersecurity dataset.},

Current languages such as Cypher and SPARQL express binary joins through the non-scalable and inefficient composition of multiple traversal and graph creation operations. In this paper, we propose an efficient equi-join algorithm that is able to perform vertex and path joins over a secondary memory indexed graph, also the resulting graph is serialised in secondary memory. The results show that the implementation of the proposed model outperforms solutions based on graphs, such as Neo4J and Virtuoso, and the relational model, such as PostgreSQL. Moreover, we propose two ways how edges can be combined, namely the conjunctive and disjunctive semantics, Preliminary experiments on the graph conjunctive join are also carried out with incremental updates, thus suggesting that our solution outperforms materialized views over PostgreSQL.},

	abstract = {Graph query languages such as Cypher are widely adopted to match and retrieve data in a graph representation, due to their ability to retrieve and transform information. Even though the most natural way to match and transform information is through rewriting rules, those are scarcely or partially adopted in graph query languages. Their inability to do so has a major impact on the subsequent way the information is structured, as it might then appear more natural to provide major constraints over the data representation to fix the way the information should be represented. On the other hand, recent works are starting to move towards the opposite direction, as the provision of a truly general semistructured model (GSM) allows to both represent all the available data formats (Network-Based, Relational, and Semistructured) as well as support a holistic query language expressing all major queries in such languages. In this paper, we show that the usage of GSM enables the definition of a general rewriting mechanism which can be expressed in current graph query languages only at the cost of adhering the query to the specificity of the underlying data representation. We formalise the proposed query language in terms declarative graph rewriting mechanisms described as a set of production rules L→R while both providing restriction to the characterisation of L, and extending it to support structural graph nesting operations, useful to aggregate similar information around an entry-point of interest. We further achieve our declarative requirements by determining the order in which the data should be rewritten and multiple rules should be applied while ensuring the application of such updates on the GSM database is persisted in subsequent rewriting calls. We discuss how GSM, by fully supporting index-based data representation, allows for a better physical model implementation leveraging the benefits of columnar database storage. Preliminary benchmarks show the scalability of this proposed implementation in comparison with state-of-the-art implementations.},

This paper provides two main contributions. First, we define a binary graph join operator that acts on the vertices as a standard relational join and combines the edges according to a user-defined semantics. Then we propose the "CoGrouped Graph Conjunctive θ-Join" algorithm running over data indexed in secondary memory.

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as an important concept, bridging the physical and digital worlds through interconnected devices. Although the idea of interconnected devices predates the term “Internet of Things”, which was coined in 1999 by Kevin Ashton, the vision of a seamlessly integrated world of devices has been accelerated by advancements in wireless technologies, cost-effective computing, and the ubiquity of mobile devices. This study aims to provide an in-depth review of existing and emerging IoT simulators focusing on their capabilities and real-world applications, and discuss the current challenges and future trends in the IoT simulation area. Despite substantial research in the IoT simulation domain, many studies have a narrow focus, leaving a gap in comprehensive reviews that consider broader IoT development metrics, such as device mobility, energy models, Software-Defined Networking (SDN), and scalability. Notably, there is a lack of literature examining IoT simulators’ capabilities in supporting renewable energy sources and their integration with Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) simulations. Our review seeks to address this gap, evaluating the ability of IoT simulators to simulate complex, large-scale IoT scenarios and meet specific developmental requirements, as well as examining the current challenges and future trends in the field of IoT simulation. Our systematic analysis has identified several significant gaps in the current literature. A primary concern is the lack of a generic simulator capable of effectively simulating various scenarios across different domains within the IoT environment. As a result, a comprehensive and versatile simulator is required to simulate the diverse scenarios occurring in IoT applications. Additionally, there is a notable gap in simulators that address specific security concerns, particularly battery depletion attacks, which are increasingly relevant in IoT systems. Furthermore, there is a need for further investigation and study regarding the integration of IoT simulators with traffic simulation for VANET environments. In addition, it is noteworthy that renewable energy sources are underrepresented in IoT simulations, despite an increasing global emphasis on environmental sustainability. As a result of these identified gaps, it is imperative to develop more advanced and adaptable IoT simulation tools that are designed to meet the multifaceted challenges and opportunities of the IoT domain.},

@article{almutairi2024,
	abstract = {The increasing popularity and attention in Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) have prompted researchers to develop accurate and realistic simulation tools. Realistic simulation for VANETs is challenging due to the high mobility of vehicles and the need to integrate various communication modalities such as Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) and Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) interactions. Existing simulators lack the capability to simulate VANET environments based on IoT infrastructure. In this work, we propose SimulatorBridger, a novel simulator that bridges IoTSim-OsmosisRES with SUMO, a traffic simulator, to simulate VANET environments with integrated IoT infrastructure. Our study focuses on analyzing the generated dataflows from V2I and V2V interactions and their impact on vehicle energy efficiency. Even though On-Board Units (OBUs) appear to have insignificant energy demands compared to other vehicle energy consumptions such as electric motors or auxiliary systems (HVAC, lights, comfort facilities), we found a near-perfect correlation between the intensity of communication dataflows and the battery consumption. This correlation indicates that increased communication activity can contribute to an increase in overall energy consumption. Furthermore, we propose future research directions, including traffic rerouting based on battery consumption optimization, which can be efficiently tested using our simulation platform. By including communication energy costs in the design of energy-efficient vehicular networks, these insights contribute to a deeper understanding of energy management in VANETs.},

	abstract = {A temporal model describes processes as a sequence of observable events characterised by distinguishable actions in time. Conformance checking allows these models to determine whether any sequence of temporally ordered and fully-observable events complies with their prescriptions. The latter aspect leads to Explainable and Trustworthy AI, as we can immediately assess the flaws in the recorded behaviours while suggesting any possible way to amend the wrongdoings. Recent findings on conformance checking and temporal learning lead to an interest in temporal models beyond the usual business process management community, thus including other domain areas such as Cyber Security, Industry 4.0, and e-Health. As current technologies for accessing this are purely formal and not ready for the real world returning large data volumes, the need to improve existing conformance checking and temporal model mining algorithms to make Explainable and Trustworthy AI more efficient and competitive is increasingly pressing. To effectively meet such demands, this paper offers KnoBAB, a novel business process management system for efficient Conformance Checking computations performed on top of a customised relational model. This architecture was implemented from scratch after following common practices in the design of relational database management systems. After defining our proposed temporal algebra for temporal queries (xtLTLf), we show that this can express existing temporal languages over finite and non-empty traces such as LTLf. This paper also proposes a parallelisation strategy for such queries, thus reducing conformance checking into an embarrassingly parallel problem leading to super-linear speed up. This paper also presents how a single xtLTLf operator (or even entire sub-expressions) might be efficiently implemented via different algorithms, thus paving the way to future algorithmic improvements. Finally, our benchmarks highlight that our proposed implementation of xtLTLf (KnoBAB) outperforms state-of-the-art conformance checking software running on LTLf logic.},

This solution should still enable recommendation systems to manipulate the aforementioned data semantically. After providing evidence of these limitations from current literature, we propose a new Generalized Semistructured data Model that makes possible queries expressible in any data representation through a Generalised Semistructured Query Language, both relying upon script v2.0 as a MetaModel language manipulating types as terms as well as allowing structural aggregation functions.},

The recent interest in this discipline for various IT sectors (cyber-security, Industry 4.0, and e-Health) calls for defining new algorithms improving the performance of existing ones. This paper focuses on generating several traces collected in a log from declarative temporal models by pre-emptively representing those as a specific type of finite state automaton: we show that this task boils down to a single-source multi-target graph traversal on such automaton where both the number of distinct paths to be visited as well as their length are bounded. This paper presents a novel algorithm running in polynomial time over the size of the declarative model represented as a graph and the desired log's size. The final experiments show that the resulting algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art data-aware and dataless sequence generations in business process management.},

Many efforts have been made in the VANET simulation area to meet the need for coupling network and road traffic simulation. However, none of them permits simulation based on IoT infrastructure. In this work, we are bridging the IoT simulation with the traffic simulation by proposing a novel simulator, Simulator-Bridger. To achieve this, our proposed simulator bridges IoTSim-OsmosisRES with Sumo, a traffic simulator, where the former had to be extended to support mobility vehicles. We substantiate the suitability of our proposed approach by showing how state-of-the-art IoT simulators can manage communication-network traffic information as generated by a real-life urban mobility scenario through VANET simulators.},

	abstract = {Auto-scaling mechanisms are frequently activated when deploying applications in the cloud environment. They are vital to ensure the application is capable of maintaining the requisite Quality of Service. The auto-scaling tools used depend heavily on the performance indicators provided via monitoring tools. Currently, the majority of the monitoring solutions available are constructed by cloud service providers. Potential therefore exists for cloud providers’ non-compliance with the defined autoscaling configurations and dishonest behaviour. Current practice therefore requires a level of trust that the cloud provider will behave in a trustworthy manner. This paper proposes an autoscaling verification mechanism based on blockchain technology to verify resource scaling decisions made by an obligated service provider. We employed a permissioned blockchain network, Hyperledger Fabric, to evaluate the performance of the proposed system as regards transaction throughput, transaction average latency, transaction success and/or failure and transaction send rate.},

Nonetheless, no technique is currently able to provide trace repair solutions in the context of data-aware declarative process models: current approaches either focus on procedural models, or numerically quantify the deviance with no proposed repair strategy. After discussing our working hypotheses, we demonstrate how such a problem can be reduced to a data-agnostic trace alignment problem, while ensuring the correctness of its solution. Finally, we show how to find such a solution leveraging Automated Planning techniques in Artificial Intelligence.

	abstract = {Declarative business process (BP) models define the behavior of BPs as a set of temporal constraints, which can be summarized as a deterministic finite state automaton (DFA). Declarative BP discovery aims at inferring such constraints from event logs. To this aim, it requires as additional input the set of candidate constraints to be verified with respect to the event log. Intuitively, this restricts the discovery task to a conformance checking activity between a predefined set of constraint templates and an event log, preventing to learn any observed behavior that is not captured by those templates. In this paper, we investigate how to leverage Model Learning (ML) for the automated discovery of the DFA underlying the behavior of a declarative BP model, without using any further a-priori information in addition to the event log. To assess the quality of the discovered DFA, we introduce a novel definition of the standard process mining quality metrics, i.e., precision, generalization and simplicity, tailored to DFAs. Finally, a preliminary evaluation performed with real-life logs shows that ML enables to generate extremely simpler DFAs than state-of-the-art BP declarative discovery techniques, keeping similar values of precision and generalization.},

Deviant executions of a business process include those that violate compliance rules, or executions that undershoot or exceed performance targets. Deviance mining is concerned with uncovering the reasons for deviant executions by analyzing event logs stored by the systems supporting the execution of a business process. In this paper, the problem of explaining deviations in business processes is first investigated by using features based on sequential and declarative patterns, and a combination of them. Then, the explanations are further improved by leveraging the data attributes of events and traces in event logs through features based on pure data attribute values and data-aware declarative rules. The explanations characterizing the deviances are then extracted by direct and indirect methods for rule induction. Using real-life logs from multiple domains, a range of feature types and different forms of decision rules are evaluated in terms of their ability to accurately discriminate between non-deviant and deviant executions of a process as well as in terms of understandability of the final outcome returned to the users. },

	url = {http://amsdottorato.unibo.it/8348/},
	abstract = {Despite graph data gained increasing interest in several fields, no data model suitable for both querying and integrating differently structured graph and (semi)structured data has been currently conceived. The lack of operators allowing combinations of (multiple) graphs in current graph query languages (graph joins), and on graph data structure allowing neither data integration nor nested multidimensional representations (graph nesting) are a possible motivation. In order to make such data integration possible, this thesis proposes a novel model (General Semistructured data Model) allowing the representation of both graphs and arbitrarily nested contents (e.g., one node can be contained by more than just one parent node), thus allowing the definition of a nested graph model, where both vertices and edges may include (overlapping) graphs. We provide two graph joins algorithms (Graph Conjunctive Equijoin Algorithm and Graph Conjunctive Less-equal Algorithm) and one graph nesting algorithm (Two HOp Separated Patterns). Their evaluation on top of our secondary memory representation showed the inefficiency of existing query languages’ query plan on top of their respective data models (relational, graph and document-oriented). In all three algorithms, the enhancement was possible by using an adjacency list graph representation, thus reducing the cost of joining the vertices with their respective outgoing (or ingoing) edges, and by associating hash values to both vertices and edges. As a secondary outcome of this thesis, a general data integration scenario is provided where both graph data and other semistructured and structured data could be represented and integrated into the General Semistructured data Model. A new query language outlines the feasibility of this approach (General Semistructured Query Language) over the former data model, also allowing to express both graph joins and graph nestings. This language is also capable of representing both traversal and data manipulation operators.},

	abstract = {Smart cities face the challenge of combining sustainable national welfare with high living standards. In the last decades, life expectancy increased globally, leading to various age-related issues in almost all developed countries. Frailty affects elderly who are experiencing daily life limitations due to cognitive and functional impairments and represents a remarkable burden for national health systems. In this paper, we proposed two different predictive models for frailty by exploiting 12 socioclinical databases. Emergency hospitalization or all-cause mortality within a year were used as surrogates of frailty. The first model was able to assign a frailty risk score to each subject older than 65 years old, identifying five different classes for tailor made interventions. The second prediction model assigned a worsening risk score to each subject in the first nonfrail class, namely the probability to move in a higher frailty class within the year. We conducted a retrospective cohort study based on the whole elderly population of the Municipality of Bologna, Italy. We created a baseline cohort of 95 368 subjects for the frailty risk model and a baseline cohort of 58 789 subjects for the worsening risk model, respectively. To evaluate the predictive ability of our models through calibration and discrimination estimates, we used, respectively, a six-year and a four-year observation period. Good discriminatory power and calibration were obtained, demonstrating a good predictive ability of the models.},

We propose a novel nested graph data model and a powerful graph nesting operator.

Further on, our model supports partial nestings under the preservation of original graph elements as well as the full recovery of the original graph. We propose an efficient nesting algorithm (THoSP) that is able to perform vertex and path nestings in a single visit of the input graph. Results of an experimental evaluation show that THoSP outperforms equivalent implementations based on graph (Cypher, SPARQL), relational (SQL) and document oriented (ArangoDB) databases.},

There are scenarios where a label can be assigned to a taxonomy and generalized patterns can be mined by replacing labels by their ancestors. In this work, we propose a novel approach to generalized frequent subgraph mining. In contrast to existing work, our approach considers new requirements from use cases beyond molecular databases. In particular, we support directed multigraphs as well as multiple taxonomies to deal with the different semantic meaning of vertices. Since results of generalized frequent subgraph mining can be very large, we use a fast analytical method of p-value estimation to rank results by significance. We propose two extensions of the popular gSpan algorithm that mine frequent subgraphs across all taxonomy levels. We compare both algorithms in an experimental evaluation based on a database of business process executions represented by graphs.},

@inproceedings{oplon1,
	abstract = {Life expectancy increases globally and brings out several
challenges in almost all developed countries all around the
world. Early screening allows to carry out policies to prevent
adverse age-related events and to better distribute the
associated financial burden on social and healthcare systems.
One of the main issues correlated to a longer lifespan is
the onset of the frailty condition that typically characterizes
who is starting to experience daily life limitations due to
cognitive and functional impairment. In literature there
are many different definitions of frailty condition, mainly
due to the large number of variables that can reduce the
autonomy of the elderly. We extend the definition proposed
by the Department of Health of the UK National Health
Service, with which a frail subject is at risk of hospitalisation
or death within a year. In particular, in this paper we
propose a predictive model for frailty condition based on
26 variables from 11 socio-clinical databases. The model
assigns a frailty risk index in the range 0 to 100 to each
subject aged over 65 years old. The risk index is stratified
in 5 expected risk classes and allows to carry out different
tailored interventions. To evaluate our method, we use a
four-year depth dataset of about 100 000 over 65 subjects.
The obtained results are compared to a dataset of patients
being treated in local health services.},

In particular, a counterpart of the relational join is not present in existing graph query languages, and consequently no efficient algorithms have been developed for this operator.
    This paper provides two main contributions. First, we define a binary graph join operator that acts on the vertices as a standard relational join and combines the edges according to a user-defined semantics. Then we propose the "CoGrouped Graph Conjunctive θ-Join" algorithm running over data indexed in secondary memory. Our implementation outperforms the execution of the same operation in Cypher and SPARQL on major existing graph database management systems by at least one order of magnitude, also including indexing and loading time. },

This desire, driven by practical necessity, guides such developer to choose development systems allowing them to investigate the problems and deepen their accredited solutions: For this reason, the “development platforms” that are gradually establishing themselves (if not already consolidating) are constituted from GNU / Linux and Android operating system. The second poses attractive prospects, as Android both adopts a customary fork of the Linux kernel while gaining momentum on the business world. Nevertheless, Android’s developers imposed on their system some architectural limitations: these can be leveraged by hackers - see device rooting - which, by knowing the weaknesses of GNU/Linux systems, might easily overcome some security restrictions.
